# Tournament-DBAPI
Python module that uses the PostgreSQL database to keep track of players and matches in a swiss-style game tournament.<br />

Swiss system for pairing up players in each round: players are not eliminated, and each player should be paired with another player with the same number of wins, or as close as possible <br />

Create the database locally first and then use the python functions to register players and view the tournament. It only works assuming there is an even number of players.
